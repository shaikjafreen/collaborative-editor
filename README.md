⚛️ React + Vite
🚀 Minimal React Setup with Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
This is a lightweight React boilerplate built with Vite for blazing-fast development. It uses Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant updates during development and includes a basic ESLint configuration to help catch common bugs.

📌 Features
⚡ Super-fast startup and build with Vite

♻️ Hot Module Replacement for smooth development

🧩 Plugin support for Babel or SWC

✅ Built-in ESLint setup

🛠️ Easily extendable for production use

🛠️ Technologies Used
React – For building UI components

Vite – As the build tool and dev server

ESLint – For static code analysis

JavaScript (or TypeScript) – For logic and component structure

GitHub – For version control and hosting

🔌 Available Plugins for React
Vite supports two main React plugins:

@vitejs/plugin-react
➤ Uses Babel
➤ Offers Fast Refresh and wide compatibility

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc
➤ Uses SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)
➤ Faster than Babel, also with Fast Refresh

Choose Babel for more compatibility or SWC for speed.

⚙️ How It Works
Vite serves your React code using modern ESM (ES Modules).

When you save changes, HMR updates only the affected modules in the browser instantly.

Plugins help you integrate JSX compilation via Babel or SWC.

ESLint catches errors during development in supported editors or CLI.

🧹 ESLint Configuration
This template includes a basic .eslintrc.cjs file to catch common issues.
You can expand it by:

Enabling type-aware linting with TypeScript

Adding rules for style guides (e.g., Airbnb, Standard, Prettier)

Using editor plugins for real-time lint feedback

✅ Production Recommendations
✅ Use TypeScript for type safety

✅ Enable type-aware ESLint rules

✅ Split components into reusable folders

✅ Lazy load large components or routes

✅ Use .env files for secrets/configs

Check out the official React + TypeScript template for an advanced setup.

🚧 To Do
 Add support for TypeScript

 Add testing with Vitest or Jest

 Set up routing (React Router DOM)

 Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling

 Add deployment config for GitHub Pages or Netlify
