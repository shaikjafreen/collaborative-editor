# React + Vite
ðŸ“¦ React + Vite Template
This project template provides a minimal React setup using Vite, optimized for fast development with Hot Module Replacement (HMR). It's a great starting point for building modern React applications with excellent speed and developer experience.

ðŸ”Œ Available Plugins
Currently, there are two official Vite plugins for React:

@vitejs/plugin-react â€“ Uses Babel under the hood and supports Fast Refresh.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc â€“ Uses SWC, a much faster compiler, also with Fast Refresh.

Both plugins are suitable depending on whether you prefer Babel (more features and compatibility) or SWC (better performance).

ðŸ§¹ ESLint Configuration
This template includes a basic ESLint setup to help you catch common issues during development. You can expand this configuration based on your teamâ€™s code style or project requirements.

âœ… Recommendation for Production
For larger or production-ready applications, itâ€™s best to:

Use TypeScript for static type checking

Enable type-aware ESLint rules to catch more bugs at development time

You can explore the React + TypeScript template provided by Vite to integrate TypeScript and advanced ESLint settings into your project.
#with the  direct links description to understand clearly
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
